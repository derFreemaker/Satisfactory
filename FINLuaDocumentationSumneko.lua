--- WARNINGS:<br>
--- - Massive power draw will occur during start-up and usage.<br>
--- - Power draw on use increases with travel distance.<br>
--- - Link start-up will take time. Letting the connection expire is not recommended.<br>
--- - Failure to deliver sufficient Singularity Cells will cause the link to expire.<br>
